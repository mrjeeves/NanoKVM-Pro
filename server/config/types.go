// Mesh configures the native AllMyStuff bridge — the daemon-socket client that
// joins the AllMyStuff cloud mesh, advertises this device as a KVM appliance,
// and tunnels its own web UI over the mesh "sites" plane.
type Mesh struct {
	// Enabled turns the bridge on. Default true; the bridge is non-fatal and
	// retries on connect failure, so it's safe to leave on even before the
	// myownmesh daemon is up.
	Enabled bool `yaml:"enabled"`
	// Name is the device's display name advertised on the mesh (the graph
	// label). Defaults to "CEC-KVM". Empty falls back to the hostname/node id.
	Name string `yaml:"name"`
	// Home is $MYOWNMESH_HOME — where the daemon's identity, rosters, and our
	// persisted KVM state (kvm-state.json) live. On the Pro this is the writable
	// ext4 /data partition, which (unlike the NanoKVM's exFAT /data) can hold a
	// Unix socket, but the control socket is still pinned to tmpfs by default for
	// one config story across both products (see Socket).
	Home string `yaml:"home"`
	// Socket is the daemon control socket path. It must live on a filesystem
	// that supports Unix sockets. The default is on the runtime tmpfs
	// (/run/myownmesh, created by the systemd unit's RuntimeDirectory=) so the
	// same value works on any device regardless of the data partition's
	// filesystem; the daemon is pointed at this same path via its systemd unit /
	// $Home/config.json, and the two must match. Empty falls back to
	// $Home/daemon.sock.
	Socket string `yaml:"socket"`
	// NetworkId overrides the device's **joining mesh** — the network an
	// unclaimed/reset KVM sits on waiting to be adopted. Empty (the default)
	// means the per-device `cec-kvm-xxxxx-xxxxx` id derived from the daemon
	// identity, which the device shows in its web UI. Set it only to pin a
	// custom joining mesh; the retired shared default ("cec-backend-client-mesh")
	// is migrated to empty on load.
	NetworkId string `yaml:"networkId"`
	// Label is the cosmetic display name for the joining mesh.
	Label string `yaml:"label"`
	// Relays is the explicit signaling relay list. Empty means use the public
	// venue default (the daemon's built-in relays).
	Relays []string `yaml:"relays"`
	// PublicClaims gates whether an unclaimed KVM is claimable over the
	// public mesh. Off (the default): the joining mesh runs LAN-only
	// signaling (mDNS, no relays) — the device can only be claimed from the
	// same local network, the id in its web UI still working for whoever is
	// standing at the hardware. On: the joining mesh signals over the relay
	// venue too (WAN claiming via the id), and the device also mints a random
	// claim code (shown on its web page) for AllMyStuff's "claim a remote
	// device" flow.
	//
	// STRICTLY DEVICE-LOCAL POLICY: settable only here, in the deployed
	// config file. There is deliberately no HTTP or mesh surface that
	// mutates it — a remote system must never be able to open a device to
	// public claiming. (Any future web toggle must reject mesh-authenticated
	// requests; see middleware.WithMeshAuth.)
	PublicClaims bool `yaml:"publicClaims"`
	// DaemonBin is the best-guess path to the myownmesh daemon binary, used by
	// the packaging/deploy tooling — not by the Go bridge directly.
	DaemonBin string `yaml:"daemonBin"`
	// HandRaise wires the physical user button to the CEC "hand raise"
	// (Ask-for-help) system.
	HandRaise HandRaise `yaml:"handRaise"`

// HandRaise configures the physical-button → CEC hand-raise integration.
type HandRaise struct {
	// ButtonEnabled wires the device's user button (the USR button on the Pro)
	// to toggle the CEC hand raise via a double short-press. It is OFF by
	// default on the Pro: unlike the PCIe board's BOOT button, the USR button
	// is not surfaced to Linux by this firmware, so the evdev node and key code
	// must be confirmed on real hardware before enabling. (The web UI and
	// /api/mesh/help endpoints raise a hand regardless of this setting.)
	ButtonEnabled bool `yaml:"buttonEnabled"`
	// InputDevice is the evdev node to read the button from. Best-guess default
	// /dev/input/event0 — verify it is the USR button before enabling.
	InputDevice string `yaml:"inputDevice"`
	// KeyCode, when non-zero, restricts the gesture to a specific evdev key
	// code. 0 (the default) matches any key.
