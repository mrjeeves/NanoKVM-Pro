// CEC "hand raise" (Ask-for-help) support.
//
// A KVM raises its hand exactly the way a CEC Support customer does: it lives
// on the one well-known **Silent** support area (`cecsupport-clients`) and
// raises its hand by **joining the asking room** (`cecsupport-asking`) — a
// second Silent mesh whose signaling membership IS the technicians' queue.
// MyOwnMesh is a mesh signaling system for direct WebRTC peer-to-peer
// connections, and a Silent room uses only that half: co-present devices see
// each other's announces, nothing ever connects on its own, and nothing is
// routed through anything (the only data-path fallback anywhere is WebRTC's
// own TURN relay when NAT rules out a direct pair). Lowering the hand is
// leaving the room. A technician answers by dialing this device directly on
// the standing area; the KVM's own consent/route gating (control.go,
// native.go) guards any actual session.
//
// This replaces the `cec.presence` channel beacons: those rode data channels,
// which a Silent area rightly never opens on its own — the exact deadlock
// that once forced the area Open (auto-connecting every customer to every
// stranger).
//
// This is a NEW, additive plane: the KVM's normal presence lives on the
// AllMyStuff graph (allmystuff-cloud-mesh-v1, see protocol.go), whereas a hand
// raise rides the CEC plane. The two never mix. Everything here mirrors
// AllMyStuff's node/src/mesh.rs (cec_ask_help / cec_help_watch),
// node/src/cec.rs (help_network_config / ask_network_config), and the wire
// contract in crates/allmystuff-cec-protocol (lib.rs, ids.rs support_id).
