// usb_watchdog_linux.go supervises the USB gadget while the server runs.
//
// Everything else in this package repairs the gadget at exactly two moments:
// once at startup (recoverUSBAtStartup) and whenever a media change touches it.
// A gadget that dies at any other time — the host cuts VBUS on a reboot, the
// controller loses its session, an enumeration never completes — stayed dead
// until somebody restarted the server or unplugged the cable, because nothing
// was watching. That is the failure this file exists to end.
//
// The signal is /sys/class/udc/<udc>/state, which the gadget framework
// maintains and which nothing here read before. It is the only authoritative
// view of the LINK. configfs' g0/UDC is a binding record: it stays populated
// across a dead link, so "is UDC non-empty" — the health test the rest of this
// package uses — cannot see this failure at all. (is_a_peripheral was tried and
// correctly abandoned for the same reason; see ensureUSBGadgetBound.)
//
// The hard part is not detecting "not attached", it is that a healthy gadget on
// a powered-off host reports exactly the same thing. Re-arming a gadget nobody
// is looking at is harmless in itself, but doing it every few seconds forever
// is churn, log noise, and a way to interrupt a host that is halfway through
// enumerating. So escalation is deliberately reluctant: see shouldRecover.
