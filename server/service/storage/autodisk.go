// `usbdev.sh restart` — a UDC unbind/rebind that tears down and recreates
// /dev/hidg0-2. Every other gadget change in this server closes HID around that
// (executeWithHidLock in service/vm/virtual_devices.go); this did not. A drive
// that waits for a reboot is a trivial cost; keyboard and mouse that stop

// replacing the inode underneath a live LUN leaves the host mid-transaction

// as "USB device not recognized". Detaching first turns that into an ordinary
// media-removed event, which every OS already knows how to handle.
