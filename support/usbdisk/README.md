# The KVM's USB drive

What the customer sees in Explorer or Finder when a CEC KVM is plugged in.

The image is built **in CI**, not on the device (`.github/workflows/release.yml`),
by the same `scripts/build-usbdisk.sh` the NanoKVM repo uses, and shipped in the
release bundle. `mkfs` has no business in a KVM's boot path, and a half-written
image is a drive the host asks the customer to format — worse than no drive.

The server attaches it at startup (`service/storage/autodisk.go`), so the
attached machine always has our files in front of it. It fills an EMPTY slot
only: virtual media shares this one LUN, so a mounted ISO always wins, and
ejecting it leaves the slot empty for the next boot to re-attach.

## autorun.inf

**Not for running anything.** Windows disabled AutoRun for removable drives in
2011 (KB971029, after Conficker) and macOS never had it; an installer here would
never launch itself, and shouldn't. What `autorun.inf` still does on a removable
volume is set the drive's **icon and name** in Explorer — so the customer sees
*CEC KVM* with our mark rather than a nameless removable disk.

CRLF line endings and 8.3-safe filenames, because Windows parses this file with
very old code.

## cec.ico

The CEC Support app icon, so the drive and the app the customer runs look like
the same thing. Kept in sync by hand with `gui/src-tauri/icons/icon.ico` in the
CECSupport repo.

## cecsupport.ps1 + CEC-Support.cmd

The route to the desktop app from the machine the KVM is plugged into. Before
this the only route was the web UI's "Desktop App" button pointing at
support.cec.direct, which requires the customer to already know where to go.

`cecsupport.ps1` asks GitHub for the **latest** CEC Support release, downloads
its x64 installer, checks the download against the digest GitHub reports for
that asset, and runs it. Nothing is pinned: the app updates itself on first run,
so a pinned install would be a stale install for about a minute, and a KVM
flashed a year ago would otherwise hand out a year-old installer.

Carrying the launcher rather than the ~37 MB installer keeps the whole drive
image under 100 KB gzipped — it rides inside every over-the-air update, and
paying 37 MB on each one for a file used once is the wrong trade.

The digest check is integrity, not provenance: the hash comes from the same
place as the file, so it proves the download was not truncated or corrupted,
and nothing more. That is the failure that actually happens on a flaky
connection, and running a half-downloaded installer is worth refusing.

`CEC-Support.cmd` is what the customer double-clicks. A `.ps1` on removable
media is not double-clickable — Windows opens it in Notepad, and the default
execution policy blocks scripts that came off removable media. The `.cmd`
invokes PowerShell with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` for that one call, changing
nothing on the machine.

Both files are written to the drive with CRLF endings by the build step, for
the same reason `autorun.inf` needs them.

## Building the drive

`scripts/build-usbdisk.sh` — one build step, shared with release CI and kept
byte-identical with the NanoKVM repo's copy. The mkfs/mcopy sequence used to be copy-pasted
between the Justfile and `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which was survivable
while the drive held two static files and stops being survivable the moment its
contents matter: a release quietly shipping a different drive than a dev deploy
is the kind of bug nobody finds until a customer is on the phone.

It fails if any expected file did not land, for the same reason the device
checks the FAT signature before exporting the drive.

## Reaching devices already in the field

The drive is a managed artifact, not the customer's scratch space — its whole
purpose is to put our files in front of the attached machine. So `installUsbDisk`
refreshes it whenever the release ships a different one, keyed on a stamp holding
the sha256 of the packed image the current drive was written from. An unchanged
release is a byte-identical compare and no SD-card write; a fixed launcher
reaches every device on its next update.

It used to refuse to touch a drive that was already formatted, which meant a
device provisioned once kept its original drive for good and every fix stopped
at the factory.
